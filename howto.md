> # How the documentation is organized
> Django has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it’s organized will help you know where to look for certain things:
>
> **Tutorials** take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a Web application. Start here if you’re new to Django or Web application development. Also look at the “First steps”.
> **Topic guides** discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
> **Reference guides** contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Django’s machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
> **How-to guides** are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Django works.
